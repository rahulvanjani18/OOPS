        "### 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing code using objects. It allows us to structure programs by combining data and the functions that work on that data into a single unit called a class. OOP helps in organizing code, making it reusable, and easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and actions (methods) that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and contains data (attributes) and behavior (methods) defined by its class.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Abstraction** hides unnecessary details and shows only essential features to the user.\n",
        "**Encapsulation** is the process of wrapping data and methods into a single unit and restricting direct access to some components.\n",
        "Abstraction is about **what to show**, and encapsulation is about **how to protect** it.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Dunder methods (also called magic methods) are special methods that start and end with double underscores, like `__init__`, `__str__`, `__add__`. They allow custom behavior for Python built-in operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance is the process where one class (child) can use the properties and methods of another class (parent). It helps in code reuse and allows building relationships between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism means \"many forms\". It allows the same method name to have different behaviors in different classes. It helps in writing flexible and reusable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is achieved using private and protected members. In Python, prefixing a variable with `_` or `__` makes it protected or private, limiting access from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A constructor is a special method called `__init__()` that is automatically run when an object is created from a class. It is used to initialize the object with default or given values.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A **class method** is defined using `@classmethod` and takes `cls` as the first parameter. It can access and modify class variables.\n",
        "A **static method** is defined using `@staticmethod` and does not take `self` or `cls`. It behaves like a regular function but is included inside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Python does not support traditional method overloading like other languages. However, we can achieve similar behavior using default arguments or `*args` and `**args` to allow multiple ways of calling a method.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Method overriding means redefining a method in the child class that already exists in the parent class. It is used to provide specific behavior in the child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A property decorator (`@property`) is used to make a method act like an attribute. It allows access to private attributes in a safe way without calling a method directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It makes the code more flexible and extensible, especially when working with collections of different object types.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "An abstract class is a class that cannot be directly instantiated. It is defined using the `abc` module and contains one or more abstract methods that must be implemented by child classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "* Helps organize and structure code\n",
        "* Promotes code reusability through inheritance\n",
        "* Allows easy modification and maintenance\n",
        "* Supports data hiding and abstraction\n",
        "* Makes complex programs easier to manage\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "A **class variable** is shared by all objects of a class and is defined outside any method using the class name.\n",
        "An **instance variable** is unique to each object and is usually defined in the constructor using `self`.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple inheritance means a class can inherit from more than one parent class. This allows the child class to use properties and methods from multiple sources, helping reuse code from different classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 19. Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "* `__str__()` returns a **readable** string version of the object, usually for end users.\n",
        "* `__repr__()` returns a more **detailed and unambiguous** string, useful for developers and debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 20. What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The `super()` function is used to call a method from the **parent class**. It is commonly used in constructors to initialize the parent class when a child class is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 21. What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The `__del__()` method is called **automatically when an object is about to be destroyed**. It is used to clean up resources, such as closing files or releasing memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 22. What is the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "* `@staticmethod`: does **not** access the class or instance. Acts like a regular function inside the class.\n",
        "* `@classmethod`: takes `cls` as a parameter and can **access or change class-level data**.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "In inheritance, polymorphism allows child classes to **override parent methods** with their own versions. When the same method is called on different objects, Python calls the correct version depending on the object type.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Method chaining means **calling multiple methods on the same object in one line**. For this to work, each method must return the object (`self`) so that the next method can be called.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 25. What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The `__call__()` method allows an object to be **called like a function**. When this method is defined in a class, calling the object using parentheses will automatically run the `__call__` method.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
